# CookieMonster
Android studio playground

#### What does this button do?
It displays a cookie image, if you click the image, a counter increments
when it gets to 10, it changes the image to a green cookie monster; blue cookie monster at 20. Magnificent.
Also has some example tests.

#### How do I make it work?
Open the project in android studio; open the emulator;
run like you'd run any other java project.
Looks at the emulator. Amaze.
